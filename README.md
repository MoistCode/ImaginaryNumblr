<h2>About</h2>
  
<p>A website primarily inspired by Tumblr that takes a more mathematical approach! Although the theme may initially come off as favoring only math; it actually takes a much deeper approach. Math is everywhere. From the fluid dynamics naturally taken into consideration by Vincent van Gogh when painting <i>Starry Night</i>, to what we all know and love, Calculus. There are absolutely no boundaries for entry and we welcome mathematicians of all levels, even if you <b>dislike</b> mathematics. So sign up, get that painting you've been working on for months or a photo of your dog and get some analysis from our top-notch <b>Numblrs</b>, maybe not of your dogs...dogs are just cute..</p>

  Edit and delete on the fly as the website will automatically generate your changes without browser refresh
</h4>  

With the power of React's state, we can create, edit, delete and whatever else we want to do without ever having to refresh to see the updates! This is done by manipulating the state of the current component which trickles an avalache effect where React compares the changes to the previous information and make changes as necessary.
