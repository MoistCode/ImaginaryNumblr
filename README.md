  <h2>About</h2>
  
  <p>A website primarily inspired by Tumblr that takes a more mathematical approach! Although the theme may initially come off as favoring only math; it actually takes a much deeper approach. Math is everywhere. From the fluid dynamics naturally taken into consideration by Vincent van Gogh when painting <i>Starry Night</i>, to what we all know and love, Calculus. There are absolutely no boundaries for entry and we welcome mathematicians of all levels, even if you <b>dislike</b> mathematics. So sign up, get that painting you've been working on for months or a photo of your dog and get some analysis from our top-notch <b>Numblrs</b>, maybe not of your dogs...dogs are just cute..</p>
