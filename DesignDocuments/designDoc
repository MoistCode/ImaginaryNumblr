  = What views are required?
  = What do those views look like?
  = How can these views be broken down into React components? Boxes!
  = Which components can be reused in different components?
  = What data does each component need to display properly?
    - Does it need a container to connect to the store?
    - Can the data be passed down from a parent as props?

Extra Notes
  = Any component ending in 'Container' will 'connect'
